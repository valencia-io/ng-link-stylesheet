# ng-link-stylesheet

## A much better alternative for inline styles.

Embed a stylesheet only when a component is shown in angularJS in order to not use a main.css with all the styles even when they are not in use.

This repo is a fork of [angular-seed][https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git] used as a playground.

### TODO
- Implement all the default attributes of the link tag.  [LINK REFERENCE](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Elemento/link)
- Clean up the playground (angular-seed)

- Create Landing
